## R Markdown

This is my first R Markdown document. It's a great way to write documents that include code and its output, as well as plots and tables. I chosed the topic of cars for this markdown.


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
